# Microservices - Martin Fowler

- [Article link](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

> the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms

> These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery

> There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies
