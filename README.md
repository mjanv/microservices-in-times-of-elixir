# Microservices in times of Elixir

From [Martin Fowler - Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html), microservices are defined as:

> the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms

> These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery

> There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies

What does it mean in Elixir ? How hard or easy it is ?

## Presentation

[Slides](docs/HumanTalks.png) are available under the form of a PNG with an embedded [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) schema in the `docs/` folder. The rest of the repository is a demo showcasing the deployment of the same application deployed with a monolith or a service-based architecture with the same repository.
